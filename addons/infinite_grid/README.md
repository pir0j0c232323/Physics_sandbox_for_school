# Infinite Grid

Reusable 2D and 3D infinite grid components for Godot 4.x.

The grid is shader-driven, keeps line widths stable in screen space, fades between LOD levels, and follows the active camera so it appears endless without generating large geometry.

## Features

- `InfiniteGrid3D`: an XZ ground grid rendered from a small procedural mesh.
- `InfiniteGrid2D`: a full-viewport `ColorRect` grid for `Camera2D` scenes.
- Smooth LOD transitions for zooming or camera distance changes.
- Screen-space line width and anti-aliasing.
- Configurable cell size, colors, opacity, and debug LOD coloring.
- No external runtime dependencies.

## Requirements

- Godot 4.x

## Installation

Copy this folder to your project:

- `res://addons/infinite_grid/infinite_grid_3d.tscn`
- `res://addons/infinite_grid/infinite_grid_2d.tscn`

## Examples

## InfiniteGrid3D

### Usage

Instance the reusable scene:

```text
res://addons/infinite_grid/infinite_grid_3d.tscn
```

Add it to a 3D scene with a `Camera3D`. By default, the grid follows the active viewport camera on the XZ plane.

### Properties

#### `follow_viewport_camera`

Default: `true`

When enabled, `InfiniteGrid3D` reads the active viewport `Camera3D` every frame and moves the grid on XZ so it stays under the camera. Disable it if you want to position the grid manually or drive it from a specific camera.

#### `grid_size`

Default: `2000.0`

Controls the side length of the finite quad used to render the grid. The shader fades near the mesh bounds, so larger values increase the visible area before the edge fade appears.

#### `edge_fade_start_ratio`

Default: `0.0`

Sets where the mesh edge fade begins as a ratio of half the grid size. The default starts fading at the grid center.

#### `edge_fade_end_ratio`

Default: `1.0`

Sets where the mesh edge fade reaches zero opacity as a ratio of half the grid size. Keep this greater than `edge_fade_start_ratio`. For example, use `0.8` and `1.0` to fade only across the outer 20% of the grid radius.

#### `cell_size`

Default: `1.0`

Defines the base world-space grid cell size. LOD levels are built around this value using powers of ten, for example `0.1`, `1.0`, `10.0`, and `100.0` when `cell_size` is `1.0`.

#### `line_width_pixels`

Default: `1.0`

Sets the target line width in screen pixels. The shader uses derivatives to keep lines visually stable as the camera moves.

#### `lod_finer_levels`

Default: `3`

Controls how many decimal LOD levels are allowed below the base `cell_size`. Each level is 10x finer than the previous one.

For example, with `cell_size = 1.0`:

```text
lod_finer_levels = 0  -> finest cell size is 1.0
lod_finer_levels = 1  -> finest cell size is 0.1
lod_finer_levels = 2  -> finest cell size is 0.01
lod_finer_levels = 3  -> finest cell size is 0.001
```

Higher values let the grid show smaller fine lines when the camera is close to the floor.

#### `lod_total_levels`

Default: `8`

Controls the total number of decimal LOD levels, including finer, base, and coarser levels. The final range starts at `cell_size * 10^-lod_finer_levels` and contains `lod_total_levels` entries.

For example, with `cell_size = 1.0`, `lod_finer_levels = 3`, and `lod_total_levels = 8`:

```text
0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0, 1000.0, 10000.0
```

If `lod_finer_levels` changes while `lod_total_levels` stays the same, the whole range shifts. For example, with `cell_size = 1.0`, `lod_finer_levels = 1`, and `lod_total_levels = 8`:

```text
0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0, 1000.0, 10000.0, 100000.0, 1000000.0
```

Increase `lod_total_levels` when the grid needs to remain useful across a wider distance range.

#### `enable_grazing_opacity`

Default: `true`

Fades the floor grid at shallow viewing angles. This reduces long transparent trails when the camera looks almost parallel to the grid plane.

#### `grazing_fade_start`

Default: `3.0`

Sets the viewing angle above the grid plane where grazing opacity starts. Fragments viewed below this angle are fully faded out.

#### `grazing_fade_end`

Default: `20.0`

Sets the viewing angle above the grid plane where grazing opacity reaches full visibility. Use a narrower range such as `5.0` to `30.0` to restrict fading to shallow viewing angles.

#### `enable_stipple_discard`

Default: `false`

Converts line alpha below `0.1` into a screen-space stipple pattern. Disable it to use regular alpha blending throughout the fade.

#### `enable_lod_center_fade`

Default: `true`

Applies a Blender-style center fade to each LOD layer. Fine lines appear near the view focus first and fade outward, which makes LOD transitions less abrupt.

#### `lod_center_fade_line_count`

Default: `151.0`

Controls the radius of each per-LOD center fade in grid-line units. The default `151.0` gives roughly 75 cells of fade radius on each side of the view focus. Odd values usually give a better result because they keep the fade region balanced around a center grid line.

#### `thin_line_color`

Default: `Color(0.42, 0.42, 0.42, 0.45)`

Color and alpha for minor grid lines. Lower alpha values make fine LOD levels less prominent.

#### `thick_line_color`

Default: `Color(0.62, 0.62, 0.62, 0.65)`

Color and alpha for major grid lines. This is used for coarser LOD levels and emphasized grid divisions.

#### `debug_lod_colors`

Default: `false`

Shows the active LOD layers with debug colors. Blue is the finer layer, green is the current layer, and red is the coarser layer.

### Methods

#### `set_grid_size(value: float) -> void`

Updates `grid_size`, rebuilds the finite grid mesh, and reapplies shader parameters.

```gdscript
$InfiniteGrid3D.set_grid_size(4000.0)
```

#### `set_cell_size(value: float) -> void`

Updates the base world-space cell size and reapplies shader parameters.

```gdscript
$InfiniteGrid3D.set_cell_size(0.5)
```

#### `follow_camera(camera: Camera3D) -> void`

Moves the grid on XZ so it is centered under the given camera.

```gdscript
$InfiniteGrid3D.follow_camera($Camera3D)
```

## InfiniteGrid2D

### Usage

Instance the reusable scene:

```text
res://addons/infinite_grid/infinite_grid_2d.tscn
```

Place it inside a `CanvasLayer` so it stays screen-aligned. Use a low layer value if the grid should render behind the game UI or world overlays:

```text
CanvasLayer
  InfiniteGrid2D
```

By default, it reads the active viewport `Camera2D`.

### Properties

#### `follow_viewport_camera`

Default: `true`

When enabled, `InfiniteGrid2D` reads the active viewport `Camera2D` every frame. Disable it when you need to pass camera state manually with `set_camera_state()`.

#### `grid_origin`

Default: `Vector2.ZERO`

Offsets the world-space origin used by the grid. Change this when the grid should align to a custom coordinate origin instead of `(0, 0)`.

#### `cell_size`

Default: `10.0`

Defines the base world-space grid cell size. LOD levels are built around this value using powers of ten.

#### `min_pixels_between_cells`

Default: `3.0`

Controls when the 2D shader switches to a coarser LOD. Increase it to hide dense fine lines sooner while zooming out.

#### `line_width_pixels`

Default: `1.0`

Sets the target line width in screen pixels. The shader uses derivatives to keep lines stable while zooming and panning.

#### `lod_finer_levels`

Default: `3`

Same as InfiniteGrid3D's [`lod_finer_levels`](#lod_finer_levels), using this component's `cell_size` as the base size.

#### `lod_total_levels`

Default: `8`

Same as InfiniteGrid3D's [`lod_total_levels`](#lod_total_levels), using this component's `cell_size` and `lod_finer_levels`.

#### `thin_line_color`

Default: `Color(0.30, 0.30, 0.30, 0.50)`

Color and alpha for minor grid lines. Lower alpha values make fine LOD levels less prominent.

#### `thick_line_color`

Default: `Color(0.42, 0.42, 0.42, 0.70)`

Color and alpha for major grid lines. This is used for coarser LOD levels and emphasized grid divisions.

#### `debug_lod_colors`

Default: `false`

Shows the active LOD layers with debug colors. Blue is the finer layer, green is the current layer, and red is the coarser layer.

### Methods

#### `set_camera_state(camera_position: Vector2, camera_zoom: Vector2, camera_rotation := 0.0) -> void`

Manually updates the camera state used by the grid shader. Set `follow_viewport_camera` to `false` before calling this every frame.

```gdscript
$GridLayer/InfiniteGrid2D.follow_viewport_camera = false
$GridLayer/InfiniteGrid2D.set_camera_state(camera_position, camera_zoom, camera_rotation)
```
